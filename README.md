# SN-Console
A command line interface written in Java


## Why?

I basically got inspired by a some really amazing open source consoles.
Therefore I decided to give it a shot and write something that looks neat and
can be useful aswell. I also thinks this is a really nice project to keep programming
because you can just add new commands whenever you feel like doing so.
Finally I think it is quiet cool to use an own written console!


## Frameworks/Tools

This application is programmed in Java using the JavaFx GUI library.
I know there are some really great open source components especially for displaying text. And I 
also know the text components in JavaFx are limited.
But for now I'll try to see how far one can get with only using the standard JavaFx components.
